        terms of grooming, but theyre not easy to train. <b>Beagles</b> are highly intelligent and can be stubborn and
        determined, but if you have the patience to take on the task, we guarantee itll be more than worth it. </p>

    <h1>Some fascinating Beagle facts you never knew</h1>

    <h2><u>They were bred for hunting</u></h2>
    <p>The <b>Beagle</b> is a scent hound and was originally bred in the UK for hunting small animals such as rabbits
        and hares
        because of its energy, endurance and excellent sense of smell. The breed has been nicknamed a nose with feet
        thanks to its nose-to-the-ground hunting skills. While <b>Beagles</b> are still sometimes used as hunting
        companions
        today, when fox hunting became popular the foxhound, a cross between the <b>Beagle</b> and the Buckhound, became
        the
        top choice for the sport.</p>
    <h2><u>Their ears help them smell</u></h2>
    <p>A <b>Beagles</b> ears are so long and floppy they can reach the end of their nose. They use their ears to help
        them
        smell as they carry scent particles up off the ground and direct them towards the nose. Humans have 5 million
        scent receptors, whereas the <b>Beagles</b> has 220 million and can be trained to recognize more than 50
        different
        scents. Just make sure you clean your dogs ears regularly; they may help them track scents, but they also trap
        moisture and this can lead to infections</p><br>
